/*
 * Class to wrap segments in memory that only contain keys. Examples include:
 *  - VERSION_REF
 *  - VERSION
 *  - TABLE_INDEX
 *  - SNAPSHOT_REF
 *  - MULTI_KEY
 *  - LOG_COMPACTED
 *  - SNAPSHOT (deprecated)
 *  This is to avoid materialising the AtomKey class for each row, particularly when operations involve many such keys.
 *  Many of these key types have special properties, such as all the contained keys having the same stream id, or all
 *  of the contained keys being of the same type, in which case further optimisations can be made.
 *  For now, this class does the bare minimum required for it's one use. Useful extensions could include:
 *  - IndexKeySegment: inheriting from this class. Would also contain start/end row/column columns, and use sortedness
 * information
 *  - ShapshotRefKeySegment: inheriting from this class. Sorted on StreamId, so would allow rapid checks for contained
 * symbol/version pairs
 *  - Filtering: maintain a bitset to represent keys (rows) that have not been filtered out. Optionally memcpy when
 *               true bits falls below some threshold
 *   - Iterators: Iterate through all the keys in the segment (or all with true bits if filtered)
 *  - HashSet operations: maintain hashes of each row for quick set membership operations
