 * The Store class aims, as much as possible, to be a fundamental, non-leaky
 * abstraction.
 *
 * It takes SegmentInMemory and writes them to a persistent storage, returning a key.
 * It also takes keys and returns several SegmentInMemory.
 *
 * Higher level operations can read from or write to a Store without any consideration
 * of what sort of storage is being written to, what compression (if any) is being
 * applied, the encoding to be used, etc.
 *
 * At the time of writing, the main implementation is AsyncStore.
