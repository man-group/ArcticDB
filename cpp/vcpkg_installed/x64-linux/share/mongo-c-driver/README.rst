About
=====

mongo-c-driver is a project that includes two libraries:

- libmongoc, a client library written in C for MongoDB.
- libbson, a library providing useful routines related to building, parsing, and iterating BSON documents.

If libmongoc is not needed, it is possible to build and install only libbson.

Documentation / Support / Feedback
==================================

The documentation is available at http://mongoc.org/.
For issues with, questions about, or feedback for libmongoc, please look into
our `support channels <http://www.mongodb.org/about/support>`_. Please
do not email any of the libmongoc developers directly with issues or
questions - you're more likely to get an answer on the `MongoDB Community Forums`_.

How To Ask For Help
-------------------

If you are having difficulty building the driver after reading the below instructions, please post on
the `MongoDB Community Forums`_ to ask for help. Please include in your post all of the following
information:

- The version of the driver you are trying to build (branch or tag).
    - Examples: ``r1.17`` (branch), ``1.9.5`` (tag)
- Host OS, version, and architecture.
    - Examples: Windows 10 64-bit x86, Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit x86, macOS 10.13
- C Compiler and version.
    - Examples: GCC 7.3.0, Visual Studio Community 2017, clang 3.9, XCode 9.3
- The output of any ``cmake``, ``make``, or other commands executed during the build.
- The text of the error you encountered.

Failure to include the relevant information will delay a useful response.
Here is a made-up example of a help request that provides the relevant
information:

  Hello, I'm trying to build the C driver with Kerberos support, from
  mongo-c-driver-1.9.5.tar.gz. I'm on Ubuntu 16.04, 64-bit Intel, with gcc
  5.4.0. I run CMake like::

    $ cmake .
    -- The C compiler identification is ;GNU 5.4.0
    -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc
    -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc -- works

    ... SNIPPED OUTPUT, but when you ask for help, include full output without any omissions ...

    -- Searching for libsasl2
    --   Not found (specify -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/sasl/lib for SASL support)
    CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (_message):
        SASL not found

  Can you tell me what I need to install? Thanks!
