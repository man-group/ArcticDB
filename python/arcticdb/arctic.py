        Creates the library named ``name``.

        Arctic libraries contain named symbols which are the atomic unit of data storage within Arctic. Symbols
        contain data that in most cases strongly resembles a DataFrame and are versioned such that all modifying
        operations can be tracked and reverted.

        Arctic libraries support concurrent writes and reads to multiple symbols as well as concurrent reads to a single
        symbol. However, concurrent writers to a single symbol are not supported other than for primitives that
        explicitly state support for single-symbol concurrent writes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name: str
            The name of the library that you wish to create.

        library_options: Optional[LibraryOptions]
            Options to use in configuring the library. Defaults if not provided are the same as documented in LibraryOptions.

        enterprise_library_options: Optional[EnterpriseLibraryOptions]
            Enterprise options to use in configuring the library. Defaults if not provided are the same as documented in
