# Library Configuration

When creating a new library, all configuration options will default to those specified in the `LibraryOptions` [documentation](api/arctic.md#arcticdb.LibraryOptions) defaults, unless overridden by an explicitly specified `LibraryOptions` object passed in to the call to `create_library`.

Note that currently library configuration options cannot be changed once the library has been created. The ability to modify library options for existing libraries will be added soon.
