# Release Tooling

This document details the release process for ArcticDB. 
ArcticDB is released onto [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/arcticdb/) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/arcticdb).

## 0. Check Internal Tests

Check Man Group's internal tests against the release candidate. See "ArcticDB - Support Process" internal wiki page.

## 1. Create a new tag

Navigate to the [Tag and Release](https://github.com/man-group/ArcticDB/actions/workflows/tag.yml) Github Action.

Click `Run Workflow` on the right hand side.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Release candidate, full release, or hotfix?**
>
> We release a new version of ArcticDB on a [regular schedule](https://github.com/man-group/ArcticDB/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open). 
> This may involve promoting a release candidate to a full release as well as releasing a new release candidate.
>
> If preparing a release for a new _major_ or _minor_ version ([SemVer versioning](http://semver.org)), create a pre-release version (X.Y.ZrcN).
>
> If preparing a release for a new _patch_ version, create a full release (X.Y.Z).
>
> If there is an outstanding release candidate (look [here](https://pypi.org/project/arcticdb/#history)) and no issues have been found, promote the release candidate to a full release (X.Y.Z).
>
> We will create a new release candidate for an existing pre-release version only to correct an issue that has been found with the additional functionality included in the prior pre-release version. In other words, we will promote rc1 to rc2 only if a bug has been found in functionality added in rc1, and not to provide a bugfix to functionality present prior to rc1.  

If creating a new release off master (pre-release or release version):
1. Type in the new version number eg `1.6.0` or `1.6.0rc0`.
2. Click `Run workflow`.

If promoting a pre-release:
1. Type in the new version number eg `1.6.0rc1` or `1.6.0`
2. Select the workflow off the source tag (e.g. `1.6.0rc0`)
3. Click `Run workflow`

If hotfixing an existing release (or pre-release) then branch off the previously-released tag, apply the necessary changes (cherry-picking from master if commits are on master), and:
1. Type in the new version number eg `1.6.1` (or `1.6.0rc2` as an example of a pre-release version)
2. Select the workflow off the source tag (e.g. `1.6.0` or `1.6.0rc1`)
2. Click `Run workflow`.

This will create a branch off of `master`, incrementing the version specified in code. 

The [build will now be running for the tag.](https://github.com/man-group/ArcticDB/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## 2. Update conda-forge recipe

[`regro-cf-autotick-bot`](https://github.com/regro-cf-autotick-bot) generally opens a PR
on [ArcticDB's feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/arcticdb-feedstock)
for each new release of ArcticDB upstream.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Do not commit directly to the feedstock repository.**
> Commits to the repository release new versions to conda-forge. Instead, changes must be made via personal forks or via the PR
> created by the [`regro-cf-autotick-bot`](https://github.com/regro-cf-autotick-bot) as described above.

You can update such a PR or create a new one to release a version, updating the
conda recipe. [Here's an example.](https://github.com/conda-forge/arcticdb-feedstock/pull/10)

You will need to update:

1. `version`, pointing to the tag created in step 1
2. The `sha256sum` of the source tarball
3. The build number (i.e. `number` under the `build` section) to `0`
4. Dependencies (if they have changed since the last version, see `setup.cfg`)
5. Rerender the feedstock's recipe to create Azure CI jobs' specification for all variants of the package

A PR is generally open with a todo-list summarizing all the required steps to perform,
before an update to the feedstock.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If releasing a pre-release version, you **must** merge the created PR into the `pr` branch and not the `main` branch. 
> This will require modifying the base branch of the created PR.

## 3. Release to PyPi

The GitHub Actions "Build and Test" job kicked off automatically at the end of step 1 will wait on approval to deploy to PyPi.

Find the job and click approve to deploy.

## 4. Release to Conda

Merge the PR created in step 3.

It will build packages, [pushing them to the `cf-staging` channel before publishing them
on the `conda-forge` channel for validation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure.html#output-validation-and-feedstock-tokens).

Packages are generally available a few dozen minutes after the CI runs' completion
on `main`.

## 5. Update the BSL conversion table

If you are releasing either a major (e.g. 2.0.0) or a minor (e.g. 1.5.0) version, please update the license conversion
schedule table [in the readme](https://github.com/man-group/ArcticDB/blob/master/README.md).

The conversion date will be two years from when the release is [published on GitHub](https://github.com/man-group/ArcticDB/releases/). This is not required if you are releasing a patch release.

## 6. Docs
The release worflow will also trigger the workflow releasing the documentation to the ArcticDB site. The documentation which will be uploaded is based of the branch from which the release will happen.
In case a release candidate is promoted to a release the workflow will upload outdated docs to the site. In this case the documentation must be deployed again by running the [docs workflow](https://github.com/man-group/ArcticDB/tree/master/.github/workflows#docsyml).

# Removing a release

**Note** - instructions in this section are only to be followed if a broken build has been released that needs to be removed. 
This section can be ignored under normal circumstances.

## Conda-forge

Conda-forge packages are immutable. As a result, packages cannot be removed entirely.

[They can, however, be marked as `broken`.](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/updating_pkgs.html#removing-broken-packages) 
This adds a new label to the package, `broken`. 
Packages with the `broken` label must be installed via a special channel (`conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken`) and thus for most users won't be visible. 

To mark an ArcticDB package as broken:

1. [Find all existing files for the given version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/arcticdb/files?version=1.6.0rc0&channel=main)
2. Create a PR that adds a new file listing every file to be marked as broken. [Here's an example](https://github.com/conda-forge/admin-requests/pull/765).
3. Wait for someone from the Core team to merge the PR.
